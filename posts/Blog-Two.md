# The Holy Grail of Shitcoin Rules

1. DO NOT FOMO ON TOP: Missed a mooner? Good, fuck off and find a new one
2. Caught a mooner and made 5-10X+? Good, TAKE YOUR FUCKING INITIALS OUT RIGHT NOW.
3. Caught a mooner 20-50x? DONT APE ANYMORE ON TOP, JUST FUCKING DONT.
4. Always leave a moonbag if you think the project might have potential. Sell 95%, leave 5% just incase
5. DO NOT APE FORKS: You missed an OG coin like Lenny, McPepe. Those are first movers.
   Forks: Baby Lenny, Baby McPepe are PUMP and DUMPS, they will NOT last. DO NOT APE FORKS.
6. Use Checksums to cross reference fork contracts and find out if it's a scam BEFORE apeing in.
   #1 choice = Defi Robot
   Alternatives: SERC Libraries, Tuf scanner: https://tufext.com/simulator
7. 99% of your favorite shit coins WILL DIE. Don't ever marry a trade, instead, secure profits and leave a moonbag.
   Golden rule: If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to Take Profit ( TP )
8. Never ape in a higher cap in 1 shot, dips will ALWAYS happen.
   "Buy 33% of your intended investment, DCA if it drops below your average with another 33%, and do it one last time if it hits another price target"
9. Crypto is PvP, Player versus Player. If ONE person makes money, that means someone else has to LOSE the money.
   Your unrealized profits of 100k USD could be GONE when you go to sleep.
   Before hitting the bed, ask yourself, are you okay with losing this money with a slight chance that it will make more? If no, take the initials out at least, and maybe even some profits on top.
10. Do your Due Diligence FAST before apeing in. If you already aped in BEFORE doing any research, start doing it RIGHT after.
    Does the dev hold 5-10% of the supply and claims it's for "Staking, vault, other bullshit"? RED FLAG. 5-10% of the supply is enough to send your invest down to practically ZERO.

- Open up the website/medium, alot of grammatical errors or shitty written sentences? RED FLAG

- Reverse search the images that are used on the website, is it a recycled project? RED FLAG

- Twitter from 1-2-3 months ago, recycled account? RED FLAG

- Feel the vibe of the TG chat, are there only clowns talking to each other with no similar groups? RED FLAG

11. Slow team or locked TG for to long.
12. If its a reward token and they slow to setup calls or inactive in chat it's probably a tax farm
