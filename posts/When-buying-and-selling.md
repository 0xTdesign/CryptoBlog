# When buying and selling

- If the name made you bullish when you saw it, then it likely did for others as well. So, chances are the dip will get eaten.
- If you see it being shilled, like Madapes, it will pump. But remember, people in the Telegram (TG) group who have already entered at the bottom are waiting for callers so they can sell for the most. Hence, why people want callers.
- Buy the dip for maximum gains, but in low-cap coins, it can also mean the dip won't come back up. You have to check the TG and see what the vibe is like. But also, go with the name.
- The best way is to layer in. Never go all-in at once, or you're screwed. Let's say you have 0.05, you can make a 0.025 buy on the first red candle and then wait to see if it dips lower. If it does, then you can DCA (dollar-cost average) and hope it moons.
- Never keep trying to catch a falling knife. You need to know when to exit. This is hard to figure out; you have to go with your gut. It's best to have a percentage of loss in mind for that trade, but it's also good to understand charts.
- Don't hold onto anything and never feel bad about selling all in a project. If you don't sell, someone else will. This applies even if they're your friend. However, if you do sell in a good project or a friend's project, take profits smartly.
- If you're happy with the profit, remember that nothing goes up forever. Take what's in front of you and never think you can get more. Nibble at the chart because when it dumps hard, you will be sad you didn't sell and happy if you did.
- If Bitlord apes, NUKE HALF the bag.
