# How to spot scams fast

1. Go on IToken or Yard Tools and click the search button. Type the name of the token you're looking at. If there are loads of similar tokens, it's likely a serial lazy rugger.
2. Check the functions in the contract address (CA) on Yard Tools.
3. If there's no Telegram (TG), website, or any information at the top of the CA, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a scam, but it does raise questions about the presence of socials or if it's just a quick hard rug.
4. No website before launch? How much do they even care? The same goes for TG and Twitter.
5. If they have a TG and it rugs, save the mod's name and tag them as "ruggers." Then, when you join a TG, you can click on the people in the group and see if you have any contacts in there.
6. Lots of emojis on Bobby Buy Bot? That's a jeet and ruggy thing to do. Why are there so many big buy bots? It's like they're trying to create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) among people.
7. ETH trending right at the start is also highly suspicious.
8. Getting people to push before lock and renounce? Suspicious.
9. If the website is "xzy," it's cheap af (as fuck). It costs nothing and is used by lots of jeets. I have a project that I made months ago and it was my first website. I pushed it with that domain, lol. But I can tell you it's cheap, and I haven't launched it yet.
