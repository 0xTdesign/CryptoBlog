# Rules on trading a Bear Market üêª

1. Avoid buying anything with a market cap (mc) higher than 30-50k.

2. It's best to wait for lock and renounce confirmation to ensure safety before making any significant investments. Even if the price is slightly higher, this approach allows for a potential pump during lock and renounce, reducing the risk of being scammed.

3. When your investment doubles, consider taking out your initial investment amount.

4. Avoid making investments when gas fees are high.

5. If a token is experiencing a rapid price increase, let it go. There will always be new opportunities every day.

6. If you're satisfied with the gains you've made, it's advisable to sell your entire investment and exit the market.

7. Never re-invest in a token after achieving substantial gains. Move on to new opportunities.

8. Whenever someone mentions a token, always check its chart and avoid making impulsive decisions due to fear of missing out (FOMO).

9. Suppose you have 0.1 ETH. Avoid putting all of it into a single token; instead, consider diversifying your investments. For example, allocate 0.03 ETH to one token, another 0.03 ETH to a different token, and reserve some for covering gas fees. This approach gives you a better chance at success.

10. It's not recommended to hold too many tokens simultaneously, as it becomes challenging to keep track of them. Aim to invest in a maximum of 3 tokens, with the ideal number being 2 or even just 1.

11. Remember, profit is profit, regardless of whether it's $10 or $100. Greed can lead to losses. Don't assume that every token you buy will yield significant returns.

Please note that these guidelines are general suggestions and may not guarantee financial success. Always conduct thorough research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
