# Bearish signs in a token

- "$" in the ticker name.
- Poor English
- Website links that don't work.
- Names that have been used extensively.
- Pinksale lock or presale. - This changes when presales become bullish
- Lock period of less than 1 month.
- Minimum LP of less than 1 ETH.
- Unable to understand Rose bot in TG (Telegram).
- Promising you the next best thing ever in this space, but their website is .io or xyz.
- Any token or exchange involving swaps.
- Anything with taxes exceeding 2%.
- Twitter account that has posts dating back a year.
- Having "BABY" in front of the token is extremely bearish. The main token is already experiencing significant growth, so why would the "baby" version reach millions? Some people may think it will, but it won't.

## IF THE TOKEN NAME MAKES YOU BULLISH, THEN IT WILL FOR OTHERS.
