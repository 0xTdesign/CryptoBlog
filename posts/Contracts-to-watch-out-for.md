## Contracts to watch out for

- Never ape Proxy contracts (Meme tokens don't need a proxy contract). Only big projects need that kind of setup, depending on what they're doing. DickFuckInu is okay with a normal contract, lol.
- Large amounts of LP at the start are a red flag.
- LP more than MC is also a red flag.
- Large buys right at the start when LP is added (I mean, like $200).
- Large supply holdings at the top.
- No limits at all are normally a sign of LP pull.
- If the top of the contract has more than one date when it was verified, this means copy-paste and rug.
- Check the deployer to see if there have been other tokens he launched.
- Funny-named functions are a big NO. The only time it's acceptable is if it relates to the project. Never ape any polish or stupid shit like Sysco.
- Any market supply of 100,000 is normally a pump and dump. You can tell by an Open trading function that sends 20% of the supply to the contract to sell. You will get rekt.
- If it has launched and there are only two buys, there is a reason why people aren't buying it.
- Contracts that haven't been verified are high risk. Some are alpha and do this, but most are scams, and they don't want you to see the functions.
- Just because the bot says it's green and safe, it can delay HP (holding period). So always try to take money out when in profit.

## ALWAYS DYOR
